<li> 25/04/2023: Two papers accepted by <b>ICML 2023</b>. 
     <br> The first paper is titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13393">"Probably Anytime-Safe Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits"</a>. Here, the agent's choices at every time instant should contain items whose sum of risks does not exceed a certain risk budget. This is joint work with Yunlong Hou and Vincent Y.&thinsp;F. Tan. 
<br> The second paper is titled <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/ScheduleMultitrack?event=24315">"Stochastic Gradient Succeeds for Bandits"</a>. Here, we analyzed a gradient-based algorithm in bandits. This is joint work with Jincheng Mei, Bo Dai, Alekh Agarwal, Csaba SzepesvÃ¡ri and Dale Schuurmans.
